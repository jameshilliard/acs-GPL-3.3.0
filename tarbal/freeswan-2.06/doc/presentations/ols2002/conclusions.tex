\section{Conclusions}

Use of virtual testing environment massively simplies automated tests.

Limitations are that one can only test Liunx 2.4 and beyond kernels.

It takes a lot of RAM and a lot of CPU, but still is cheaper than
coordinating many physical machines.

The resulting simplication due to refactoring means that creating new 
tests is easy, and therefore many new tests will be created.
