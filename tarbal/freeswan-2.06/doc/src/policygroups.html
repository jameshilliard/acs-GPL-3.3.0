<h1>How to Configure Linux FreeS/WAN with Policy Groups</h1>


<A NAME="policygroups"></A>

<H2>What are Policy Groups?</H2>


<P><STRONG>Policy Groups</STRONG> are an elegant general mechanism 
to configure FreeS/WAN. They are useful for
many FreeS/WAN users.</P>

<P>In previous FreeS/WAN versions, you needed to configure each IPsec 
connection explicitly, on both local and remote hosts.
 This could become complex.</P>

<P>By contrast, Policy Groups allow you to set local IPsec policy
for lists of remote hosts and networks,
simply by listing the hosts and networks which you wish to 
have special treatment in one of several Policy Group files.
FreeS/WAN then internally creates the connections 
needed to implement each policy.</P>

<P>In the next section we describe our five Base Policy Groups, which
you can use to configure IPsec in many useful ways. Later, we will 
show you how to create an IPsec VPN using one line of configuration for 
each remote host or network.</P>


<A NAME="builtin_policygroups"></A><H3>Built-In Security Options</H3>

<P>FreeS/WAN offers these Base Policy Groups:</P>

<DL>

<DT>private</DT>

<DD>
FreeS/WAN only communicates privately with the listed 
<A HREF="glossary.html#CIDR">CIDR</A> blocks.
If needed, FreeS/WAN attempts to create a connection opportunistically.
If this fails, FreeS/WAN blocks communication.
Inbound blocking is assumed to be done by the firewall. FreeS/WAN offers 
firewall hooks but no modern firewall rules to help with inbound blocking.

</DD>

<DT>private-or-clear</DT>
<DD>

FreeS/WAN prefers private communication with the listed CIDR blocks.
If needed, FreeS/WAN attempts to create a connection opportunistically.
If this fails, FreeS/WAN allows traffic in the clear.

</DD>

<DT>clear-or-private</DT>

<DD>
FreeS/WAN communicates cleartext with the listed CIDR blocks, but
also accepts inbound OE connection requests from them.
Also known as <A HREF="glossary.html#passive.OE">passive OE (pOE)</A>, 
this policy may be used to create an 
<A HREF="glossary.html#responder">opportunistic responder</A>.
</DD>

<DT>clear</DT>
<DD>
FreeS/WAN only communicates cleartext with the listed CIDR blocks.
</DD>

<DT>block</DT>
<DD>FreeS/WAN blocks traffic to and from and the listed CIDR blocks.
Inbound blocking is assumed to be done by the firewall. FreeS/WAN offers 
firewall hooks but no modern firewall rules to help with inbound blocking.
<!-- also called "blockdrop".-->

</DD>

</DL>

<A NAME="policy.group.notes"></A><P>Notes:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Base Policy Groups apply to communication with this host only.</LI>
<LI>The most specific rule (whether policy or pre-configured connection) 
applies.
This has several practical applications:
<UL>
<LI>If CIDR blocks overlap, FreeS/WAN chooses 
the most specific applicable block.</LI>
<LI>This decision also takes into account any pre-configured connections
you may have.</LI>
<LI>If the most specific connection is a pre-configured connection,
the following procedure applies. If that connection is up, it will be
used. If it is routed, it will be brought up. If it is added, 
no action will be taken.</LI>
</UL>
<LI>Base Policy Groups are created using built-in connections.
Details in 
<A HREF="manpage.d/ipsec.conf.5.html">man ipsec.conf</A>.</LI>
<LI>All Policy Groups are bidirectional. 
<A HREF="src/policy-groups-table.html">This chart</A> shows some technical 
details.
FreeS/WAN does not support one-way encryption, since it can give users
a false sense of security.</LI>
</UL>


<H2>Using Policy Groups</H2>

<P>The Base Policy Groups which build IPsec connections rely on Opportunistic
Encryption. To use the following examples, you 
must first become OE-capable, as described 
in our <A HREF="quickstart.html#quickstart">quickstart guide</A>.


<A NAME="example1"></A><H3>Example 1: Using a Policy Group</H3>

<P>To use any policy group, place CIDR blocks (<A HREF="#dnswarning">names</A>, 
IPs or IP ranges) in the policy group file 
/etc/ipsec.d/policies/<VAR>[groupname]</VAR>. Then, reread all the policy
group files so that the change takes effect.</P> 

<P>One common use: when running OE, connections may be slow at startup.
To avoid these delays, run a caching DNS server locally, and place the 
primary DNS server on which this relies in the <VAR>clear</VAR> policy 
group. Refer to it by IP to avoid a name lookup. For example:</P>

<PRE>    [root@xy root]# cat /etc/ipsec.d/policies/clear
    # This file defines the set of CIDRs (network/mask-length) to which
    # communication should always be in the clear.
    ....
    192.0.2.192   # upstream nameserver's IP.
    </PRE>
                                                                                
<P>To make the change take effect, reload your policies with:</P>
                                                                                
<PRE>    ipsec auto --rereadgroups</PRE>

<P>Of course, if the upstream DNS server is OE capable, this is not 
necessary.</P>


<A NAME="example2"></A><H3>Example 2: Choosing a Default Policy</H3>


<P>You will likely want to define a default behaviour when communicating
with systems for which you have no pre-configured connection in 
<VAR>ipsec.conf</VAR>.

A popular default policy is <VAR>private-or-clear</VAR>, which tells 
FreeS/WAN to prefer encrypted communication to the listed CIDR blocks.
Failing that, it allows talk in the clear.

To make this your default policy, place
<A HREF="glossary.html#fullnet">fullnet</A> (0.0.0.0/0)
in the <VAR>private-or-clear</VAR> policy group file:</P>

<PRE>    [root@xy root]# cat /etc/ipsec.d/policies/private-or-clear
    # This file defines the set of CIDRs (network/mask-length) to which
    # communication should be private, if possible, but in the clear otherwise.
    ....
    0.0.0.0/0</PRE>

<P>and reload your policies with</P>

<PRE>    ipsec auto --rereadgroups</PRE>

<P>Then, test your ability to create OE connections with <A HREF="quickstart.html#opp.test">this test</A>.</P>


<A NAME="example3"></A><H3>Example 3: Defining Local Security Policy</H3>

<P>You can combine our base policy groups to create local IPsec security policy.
Just put CIDR blocks in the appropriate group files. 
For example:</P>


<PRE>    [root@xy root]# cd /etc/ipsec.d/policies
    [root@xy policies]# cat private
        192.0.2.96/27              # The finance department
        192.0.2.192/29             # HR
	192.0.2.12                 # HR gateway
        irc.private.example.com    # Private IRC server
  
    [root@xy policies]# cat private-or-clear
        0.0.0.0/0                  # My default policy: try to encrypt.

    [root@xy policies]# cat clear
        192.0.2.18/32              # My POP3 server
        192.0.2.19/32              # My Web proxy

    [root@xy policies]# cat block
        spamsource.example.com</PRE>

<P>To make these settings take effect, type:</P>
<PRE>    ipsec auto --rereadgroups</PRE>

<P>Notes:</P>
<UL>
<LI>For opportunistic connection attempts to succeed, all participating
FreeS/WAN hosts and gateways must be configured for OE.</LI>
<LI>The next examples show how to implement a detailed <VAR>private</VAR>
policy.</LI>
<LI>
<A NAME="dnswarning"></A>
<FONT COLOR=RED>Warning:</FONT> Using DNS names in policy group files and 
<VAR>ipsec.conf</VAR>
can be tricky. If the name does not resolve, the policy will not be 
implemented for that name.
It is therefore safer either to use IPs, or to put any critical names 
in /etc/hosts.
We plan to implement periodic DNS retry to help with this.
<BR>
Names are resolved at FreeS/WAN startup, or when the policies are reloaded.
Unfortunately, name lookup can hold up the startup process. 
If you have fast DNS servers, the problem may be less severe.
</LI>
<LI>A complete IPsec security policy must also consider 
<A HREF="doc/firewall.html">firewalling</A>.
</UL>


<A NAME="example4"></A><H3>Example 4: An IPsec VPN with the 
<VAR>private</VAR> Group</H3>


<P>You can create an IPsec VPN with only one line of configuration per host, 
using the <VAR>private</VAR> policy group.</P>

<P>First, use our <A HREF="quickstart.html">quickstart 
guide</A> to set up each participating host
with a FreeS/WAN install and OE.</P>

<P>In one host's <VAR>/etc/ipsec.d/policies/private</VAR>, 
list the peers to which you wish to protect traffic.
For example:</P>

<PRE>    [root@xy root]# cd /etc/ipsec.d/policies
    [root@xy policies]# cat private
        192.0.2.9              # several hosts at example.com
        192.0.2.11             
        192.0.2.12                 
        irc.private.example.com 
</PRE>

<P>Copy this <VAR>private</VAR> file to each host. Remove the local host, and 
add the host which you first configured.</P>

<PRE>    scp2 /etc/ipsec.d/policies/private root@192.0.2.12:/etc/ipsec.d/policies/private</PRE>

<P>On each host, reread the policy groups with</P>

<PRE>    ipsec auto --rereadgroups</PRE>


<P>Test by pinging between two hosts. After a second or two, 
traffic should flow, and</P>

<PRE>    ipsec eroute</PRE>

<P>should yield something like</P>

<PRE>    192.0.2.11/32   -> 192.0.2.8/32  => tun0x149f@192.0.2.8</PRE>

<P>where your host IPs are substituted for 192.0.2.11 and 192.0.2.8.</P>

<P>If traffic does not flow, there may be an error in your OE setup. 
Revisit our <A HREF="quickstart.html">quickstart guide</A>.</P>


<P>The next two examples show you how to add subnets to this IPsec VPN.</P>


<A NAME="example5"></A><H3>Example 5: Protecting a Subnet</H3>

<P>To protect traffic to a subnet behind your FreeS/WAN gateway, 
you'll need additional DNS records, and new policy groups.
Suppose you wish to secure traffic to a subnet 192.0.2.192/29
behind 192.0.2.12, an OE-capable gateway.</P>

<P>To set up the DNS, use our <A HREF="adv_config.html#opp.gate">gateway OE 
instructions</A>.</P>

<P>To create the policy groups for your subnet, 
copy these connections to <VAR>/etc/ipsec.conf</VAR>. 
Substitute your subnet's IPs for 192.0.2.128/29.</P>

<PRE>
conn private-net
    also=private  # inherits settings (eg. auto=start) from built in conn
    leftsubnet=192.0.2.128/29  # your subnet's IPs here

conn private-or-clear-net
    also=private-or-clear
    leftsubnet=192.0.2.128/29

conn clear-or-private-net
    also=clear-or-private
    leftsubnet=192.0.2.128/29

conn clear-net
    also=clear
    leftsubnet=192.0.2.128/29

conn block-net
    also=block
    leftsubnet=192.0.2.128/29
</PRE>

<P>Copy the base policy group files (which apply to the gateway's connections)
to serve as the initial policy group files for the subnet's groups:</P>

<PRE>
    cp -p /etc/ipsec.d/policies/private /etc/ipsec.d/policies/private-net
    cp -p /etc/ipsec.d/policies/private-or-clear /etc/ipsec.d/policies/private-or-clear-net
    cp -p /etc/ipsec.d/policies/clear-or-private /etc/ipsec.d/policies/clear-or-private-net
    cp -p /etc/ipsec.d/policies/clear /etc/ipsec.d/policies/clear-net
    cp -p /etc/ipsec.d/policies/block /etc/ipsec.d/policies/block
</PRE>

<P><STRONG>Tip: Since a missing policy group file is equivalent to a file with 
no entries, you need only create files for the connections 
you'll use.</STRONG></P>

<P>To test one of your new groups, place fullnet (0.0.0.0/0) in 
<VAR>private-or-clear-net</VAR>. 
Ping from a box on the subnet to another OE-protected box.

You should see a connection, and</P>

<PRE>    ipsec eroute</PRE>

<P>should include an entry which mentions the subnet node's IP and the 
OE test site IP, like this:</P>

<PRE>    192.0.2.131/32   -> 192.139.46.77/32  => tun0x149f@192.0.2.11</PRE>


<A HREF="example6"></A><H3>Example 6: Adding the Subnet to the VPN</H3>

<P>We can now add the OE-capable subnet
from <A HREF="#example5">Example 5</A> to 
to the IPSec VPN we created in <A HREF="#example4">Example 4</A>.
</P>

<P>On each other host in the VPN, add the subnet 192.0.2.192/29 to 
the <VAR>private</VAR> policy group file, yielding for example</P>

<PRE>    [root@xy root]# cd /etc/ipsec.d/policies
    [root@xy policies]# cat private
        192.0.2.9              # several hosts at example.com
        192.0.2.11
        192.0.2.12             # HR department gateway
        192.0.2.192/29         # HR subnet
        irc.private.example.com
</PRE>


<P>and reread policy groups with </P>

<PRE>    ipsec auto --rereadgroups</PRE>

<P>The subnet should now be part of the VPN.
Test by pinging from a machine on the subnet 192.0.2.192/29 to any other host
on the VPN:
</P>

<PRE>    [root@192.0.2.194]# ping 192.0.2.11</PRE>


<P>After a second or two, traffic should flow, and</P>

<PRE>    ipsec eroute</PRE>

<P>should yield something like</P>

<PRE>    192.0.2.11/32   -> 192.0.2.194/32  => tun0x149f@192.0.2.12

<H2>Appendix</H2>

<A NAME="hiddenconn"></A><H3>Our Hidden Connections</H3>


<P>Our Base Policy Groups are created using hidden connections.
These are spelled out in

<A NAME="custom_policygroups"></A><H3>Custom Policy Groups</H3>

<P>A policy group is built using a special connection description
in <VAR>ipsec.conf</VAR>, which:</P>

<UL>
<LI>is <STRONG>generic</STRONG>. It uses 
<VAR>right=[%group|%opportunisticgroup]</VAR> rather than specific IPs. 
The connection is cloned for every name or IP range listed in its Policy Group
file.</LI>
<LI>often has a <STRONG>failure rule</STRONG>. This rule, written
<VAR>failureshunt=[passthrough|drop|reject|none]</VAR>, tells FreeS/WAN 
what to do with packets for these CIDRs if it fails to establish the connection.
Default is <VAR>none</VAR>.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>To create a new group:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Create its connection definition in <VAR>ipsec.conf</VAR>.</LI>
<LI>Create a Policy Group file in <VAR>/etc/ipsec.d/policies</VAR>
