This tests "ipsec rsasigkey" functionality.

This tests failures to generate a key. Specifically two tests are done:
     1) when there aren't enough random bits.
     2) when the bits just aren't random.

The random device is a file, since repeatability is important.

devrandom.bin created with:
      dd if=/dev/random ibs=1 obs=512 count=128 of=devrandom.bin

/dev/zero is used for "non-random" bits.
