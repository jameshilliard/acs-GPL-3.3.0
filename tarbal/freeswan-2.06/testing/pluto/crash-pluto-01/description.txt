This test is a variation of oe-road-01.
It involves having a road warrior at a non-fixed location talking to a 
non-mobile host. The non-mobile crashes. (We arrange this by killing
pluto with SIGSEGV, and then restarting). 

This results in a non-functional system. This is shown with a ping.

This can be fixed with "ipsec whack --crash east", causing road to 
forget all the state that it has for east, and re-initializating everything.

{eventually, we'd like to have this kind of thing occur automatically}
