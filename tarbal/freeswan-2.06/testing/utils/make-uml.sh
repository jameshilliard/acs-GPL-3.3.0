#
# Revision 1.27  2002/11/11 02:44:25  mcr
# 	add ability to provide per-UML-patch patches in case we need
# 	to use a particular iteration of UML, but there are still
# 	problems with it.
#
# Revision 1.26  2002/08/26 15:37:27  mcr
# 	used wrong sense when looking for NONINTPATCH, -z is needed.
#
# Revision 1.25  2002/08/25 19:39:15  mcr
# 	added missing "then" to NONINTPATCH test.
#
# Revision 1.24  2002/08/25 17:39:45  mcr
# 	apply the RH nonint-config patch if we can find it
# 	either in $TESTINGROOT, or via $NONINTPATCH.

# 	do not install FreeSWAN for "regular hosts"
#
# Revision 1.22  2002/08/02 22:33:30  mcr
# 	call setup_make for common makefile portions.
#
# Revision 1.21  2002/07/29 02:46:09  mcr

#
# Revision 1.20  2002/07/29 01:02:20  mcr
# 	instead of actually doing all the operations, build
# 	a makefile in $POOLSPACE that will do it whenever necessary.
#
# Revision 1.18  2002/06/17 04:23:13  mcr
# 	make-uml.sh is mature enough to not need set -x now.
#
# Revision 1.17  2002/06/03 01:23:36  mcr
# 	added "nopromptgo" and "rcf" to provide documented "oldgo" and "ocf"
# 	functionality.
# 	"oldgo" and "ocf" now will permit interaction with the user as
# 	permitted (and undocumented) by many users.
#
# Revision 1.16  2002/04/24 07:55:32  mcr
# 	#include patches and Makefiles for post-reorg compilation.
#
# Revision 1.15  2002/04/05 01:21:39  mcr
# 	make-uml script was building statically linked FreeSWAN kernels
# 	only by fluke - turns out that "make oldconfig" blows away
# 	any options in .config that weren't defined. Thus, the initial
# 	build of a non-SWAN kernel before building FreeSWAN would
# 	blow away the CONFIG_IPSEC options- specifically the CONFIG_IPSEC=y
# 	(vs =m). This worked before because "make insert" put the
# 	options back in, but now that the default has changed to modules,
# 	the it defaults the wrong way.
# 	Solution: copy the .config file in again after the plain build.
#
# Revision 1.14  2002/04/03 23:42:18  mcr
# 	force copy of swan kernel config file to get right IPSEC=y options.
# 	redirect some build output to a local file.
#
# Revision 1.13  2002/02/16 20:56:06  rgb
# Force make programs so UML does not depend on top level make programs.
#
# Revision 1.12  2002/02/13 21:39:16  mcr
# 	change to use uml*.config files instead.
# 	uml*.config files have been updated for 2.4.7-10 UML patch.
#
# Revision 1.11  2002/01/11 05:26:03  rgb
# Fixed missing semicolon bug.
#
# Revision 1.10  2001/11/27 05:36:30  mcr
# 	just look for a kernel in build directory. This
# 	type of "optomization" is dumb - it should be a makefile.
#
# Revision 1.9  2001/11/23 00:36:01  mcr
# 	take $FREESWANDIR as command line argument.
# 	use HS's "devready" instead of fudging our own.
