# $Log: Makefile,v $
# Revision 1.4  2003/06/29 21:34:49  mcr
# 	added "NOINSTALL" to omit install: target from common
# 	Makefile so that it can be overridden
#
# Revision 1.3  2003/06/25 03:57:45  mcr
# 	build, but do not install "ikeping" even when we do not
# 	want it as part of the system.
#
# Revision 1.2  2002/06/02 22:02:14  mcr
# 	changed TOPDIR->FREESWANSRCDIR in all Makefiles.
# 	(note that linux/net/ipsec/Makefile uses TOPDIR because this is the
# 	kernel sense.)
#
# Revision 1.1  2002/04/24 07:55:32  mcr
# 	#include patches and Makefiles for post-reorg compilation.
