<H2><A name="who.install">Not everyone needs to install from source</A></H2>
<P>Some Linux distributions,<A href="intro.html#distwith"> listed in the
 introduction</A>, ship with FreeS/WAN included. If you are using one of
 them, you need not perform a FreeS/WAN installation. That should all be
 done for you already. All you have to do is:</P>
<UL>
<LI>include FreeS/WAN in your installation choices, or add it to your
 configuration later</LI>
<LI>if you install kernel source, be sure to use a version which
 includes the FreeS/WAN patches. This should be available from your CDs
 or from the web site for your distribution.</LI>
</UL>
<P>For other distributions, you may be able to find pre-packaged RPMs
 and use the<A href="quickstart.html"> simple installation</A> we
 describe in our quickstart document.</P>
<P>If either of those methods works for you, we recommend you use it.
 Once that is done, continue at<A href="quickstart.html#enable">
 enabling FreeS/WAN</A> in our quickstart document.</P>
<H2><A NAME="15_2">Some people do need to install from source</A></H2>
<P>Unfortunately, due to<A href="politics.html#exlaw"> export laws</A>
 restricting distribution of strong cryptography, not all distributions
 include FreeS/WAN. Moreover, the standard kernel does not include the
 kernel parts of FreeS/WAN.</P>
<P>Also, if you need to add patches to the FreeS/WAN code (see<A href="web.html#patch">
 this list</A>), you need to do that and then install FreeS/WAN from the
 patched source.</P>
<P>Many people will need to install FreeS/WAN from source, including
 patching and rebuilding their kernel.</P>
<P>Information on<A href="#not-install"> re-installing or un-installing</A>
 is provided near the end of this document.</P>
<H2><A name="before">Before starting the install</A></H2>
<P>Configure, compile, install, and test a Linux kernel, without
 FreeS/WAN.</P>
<P>If you have not done this before, you will need to read the<A href="http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html">
 Kernel HowTo</A>. You might also look at this<A href="http://www.techtv.com/screensavers/print/0,23102,2433297,00.html">
 magazine article</A>.</P>
<H3><A name="choosek">Choosing a kernel</A></H3>
<P>The general rule is choose a current release of a production kernel
 -- the latest 2.2 or 2.4.</P>
<P>For specific information on which kernels a FreeS/WAN release
 supports, see the<A href="../README"> README</A> file in that release.</P>
<H4><A name="2.2">2.2.x for many users</A></H4>
<P>Many users can continue to run kernels from the 2.2 series of Linux
 production<A href="glossary.html#kernel"> kernels</A>.</P>
<P>We recommend using the latest release in that series. At time of
 writing (Feb 2002), that is 2.2.20.</P>
<P>If you need to use an older 2.2.x kernel for some reason, be warned
 that recent versions of FreeS/WAN will not compile out-of-the-box on a
 kernel earlier than 2.2.19. A workaround is described in the FreeS/WAN
 1.91 section of our<A href="../CHANGES"> CHANGES</A> file. See the<A href="mail.html">
 mailing list archives</A>, around June 2001, for more details if
 needed.</P>
<H4><A name="2.4">2.4.x is possible</A></H4>
 The 2.4 series of kernels are currently (Feb 2002) at 2.4.18.
<P>2.4 has new firewalling code called<A href="http://www.netfilter.org">
 nefilter</A>. This may provide good reasons to move to 2.4, especially
 on for gateway machines.</P>
<P><STRONG>Do not use 2.4.15</STRONG>; it has a bug that causes file
 system corruption.</P>
<H4><A name="2.0">2.0.x may still work</A></H4>
<P>If you must use the older 2.0.x kernel series -- for example because
 you need some driver that has not been ported to later kernels -- you
 may be in luck. When last tested, FreeS/WAN worked fine on 2.0.39.</P>
<P>On the other hand, you may have problems in the future. Recent
 versions of FreeS/WAN are not heavily tested on 2.0 kernels -- most of
 both the development team and the user community are on 2.2, or even
 2.4, by now -- and<STRONG> we are almost certain to drop 2.0 support</STRONG>
 whenever some problem crops up that would mean retaining it required
 significant work from our team.</P>
<H4><A name="devkernel">Development kernels</A></H4>
 Development kernels are a separate series, work-in-progress versions
 for use by kernel developers. By convention, production kernels have an
 even second digit in the version number (2.0, 2.2, 2.4) and development
 kernels have an odd digit there (2.1, 2.3, 2.5).
<P><STRONG>Development kernels are not intended for production use</STRONG>
. They change often and include new code which has not yet been
 thoroughly tested.<STRONG> These changes often break things, including
 FreeS/WAN</STRONG>. The FreeS/WAN team does not have the resources to
 chase the moving target; our priority is developing FreeS/WAN on stable
 kernels. If you encounter a problem on a development kernel, please
 solve it (you are a developer, aren't you?) and send us a patch. Of
 course, we will happily discuss problems and solutions on the<A href="mail.html">
 mailing list</A>, but we are unlikely to do much work on actually
 implementing a solution.</P>
<P>Fortunately we have a user who regularly fixes problems with
 FreeS/WAN on development kernels (merci, Marc), and we do fix some
 ourselves. FreeS/WAN often works just fine on a development kernel;
 it's just that there's no guarantee.</P>
<P>If you are going to test FreeS/WAN with a development kernel, we
 recommend you<STRONG> use our latest snapshot</STRONG>. This is the
 FreeS/WAN version most likely to have the patches required to work on a
 recent development kernel. The released version of FreeS/WAN is likely
 to be out of date for your purposes.</P>
<H3><A name="getkernel">Things you must have installed</A></H3>
<P>If you have a CD distribution of Linux, it should include everything
 you need.</P>
<H4><A name="tool.lib">Tools and libraries</A></H4>
<P> Use your distribution's tools to load:</P>
<UL>
<LI>tools

</UL>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>There are some<STRONG> common slips</STRONG> worth avoiding here:</P>
<UL>
<LI>not installing the GMP library. Pluto will not compile without it.
 See the FreeS/WAN FAQ for<A href="faq.html#gmp.h_missing"> more detail</A>
 if required.</LI>
<LI>not installing patch(1). Our scripts need it to apply our patches to
 the kernel.</LI>
</UL>
<H4><A name="kernel.">Kernel source code</A></H4>
<P> You need the source code for the kernel because you must patch and
 re-compile it to install FreeS/WAN. There are several places you can
 get this:</P>
<UL>
<LI>off your distribution CDs</LI>
<LI>from your ditribution vendor's website</LI>
<LI>from kernel.org</LI>
</UL>
<H5><A name="kernel.cd">Kernel from CD</A></H5>
 You can install the kernel from your distribution CD. It may be in two
 packages.
<UL>
<LI>kernel source</LI>
<LI>kernel headers</LI>
</UL>
 However, if your CD is not recent, it may have an older kernel, in
 which case we suggest getting more recent kernel source from the net.
<H5>Vendor kernels</H5>
<P>All the major distribution vendors provide kernel source. See for
 example:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Red Hat's list of<A href="http://www.redhat.com/mirrors.html">
 mirror sites</A></LI>
<LI>SuSE's<A href="http://www.suse.com/us/support/download/index.html">
 download page</A></LI>
</UL>
<P>Using a kernel from your distribution vendor may save you some
 annoyance later.</P>
<P>Different distributions put the kernel in different places (/vmlinuz,
 /boot/vmlinuz, /boot/vmlinuz-2.2.15 ...) and set lilo (the<STRONG> Li</STRONG>
nux<STRONG> lo</STRONG>ader) up differently. With a kernel from your
 distribution vendor, everything should work right. With other
 combinations, a newly compiled kernel may be installed in one place
 while lilo is looking in another. You can of course adjust the kernel
 Makefile and/or /etc/lilo.conf to solve this problem, but we suggest
 just avoiding it.</P>
<P>Also, distributions vendors may include patches or drivers which are
 not part of the standard kernel. If you install a standard kernel, you
 must either do without those features or download those patches and add
 them yourself.</P>
<H5>Kernels from kernel.org</H5>
 For kernels direct from Linus, without any distribution vendor's
 modifications, see the<A href="http://www.kernel.org/mirrors/">
 kernel.org</A> mirror list, or go directly to<NOBR><VAR>
 ftp.&lt;country&gt;.kernel.org</VAR>,with the appropriate two-letter country
 code inserted.
<H4>Once you've found a kernel</H4>
<P>Once you have found suitable kernel source, choose a mirror that is
 close to you and bookmark it.</P>
<P>Kernel source normally resides in<VAR> /usr/src/linux</VAR>, whether
 you load it from a distribution CD or download a tar file into<VAR>
 /usr/src</VAR> and untar it there. Unless you both have unusual
 requirements and know exactly what you're doing, we recommend you put
 it there.</P>
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Some recent distributions (certainly Redhat
 7.2 and Mandrake 8.1, perhaps others) put kernel source code in a
 directory named<VAR> linux-2.4</VAR> while FreeS/WAN expects to find it
 in<VAR> linux</VAR>, which is where all distributions used to put it
 and the kernel.org kernels still do. If your distribution uses<VAR>
 linux-2.4</VAR>, then<STRONG> you must create a symbolic link to<VAR>
 linux</VAR></STRONG> before proceeding with your FreeS/WAN install. See
 the man page for ln(1) for details of how to do this if required.</P>
<H3><A NAME="15_3_3">Getting FreeS/WAN</A></H3>
<P>You can download FreeS/WAN from our<A href="ftp://ftp.xs4all.nl/pub/crypto/freeswan/">
 primary site</A> or one of our<A href="intro.html#sites"> mirrors</A>.</P>
<P>Put the tarfile under<VAR> /usr/src</VAR> and untar it there. The
 command to use is:</P>
<UL>
<LI>tar -xzf freeswan*.gz</LI>
</UL>
<P>This will give you a directory<VAR> /usr/src/freeswan&lt;version&gt;</VAR>.</P>
<P>Note that<STRONG> these methods don't work:</STRONG></P>
<UL>
<LI>putting freeswan under<VAR> /usr/src/linux</VAR>. The links become
 confused.</LI>
<LI>untarring in one place, then using<VAR> cp -R</VAR> to move it where
 you want it. Some necessary symbolic links are not copied.</LI>
</UL>
<H3><A name="kconfig">Kernel configuration</A></H3>
<P>The gateway kernel must be configured before FreeS/WAN is added
 because some of our utilities rely on the results of configuration.</P>
<P><STRONG>Note for Redhat 7.1 users</STRONG>: If you are using the
 Redhat-supplied kernel, then you<STRONG> must do a<NOBR><VAR> make
 mrproper</VAR></STRONG> command before starting the kernel
 configuration. This prevents some unpleasant interactions between
 Redhat's config and our patches.</P>
<P>On some distributions, you can get the configuration files for the
 vendor's standard kernel(s) off the CD, and use that. This allows you
 to skip this step; you need not configure the kernel if the vendor has<EM>
 and you have the vendor's config file installed</EM>. Here is a mailing
 list message describing the procedure for Redhat:</P>
<PRE>Subject: Re: [Users] Do I need to recompile kernel 2.2.17-14?
   Date: Wed, 6 Jun 2001 08:38:38 -0500
   From: &quot;Corey J. Steele&quot; &lt;csteele@mtron.com&gt;

if you install the corresponding kernel-source-*.rpm, you can actually find
the config file used to build that kernel in /usr/src/linux/Configs, just
copy the one you want to use (based solely on architecture) to
/usr/src/linux/.config, and proceed!  It should work.</PRE>
 If you have ever configured the kernel yourself on this machine, you
 can also skip this step.
<P>If the kernel has not been configured, do that now. This is done by
 giving one of the following commands in<VAR> /usr/src/linux</VAR>:</P>
<DL>
<DT>make config</DT>
<DD>command-line interface</DD>
<DT>make menuconfig</DT>
<DD>text menus (requires curses(3) libraries)</DD>
<DT>make xconfig</DT>
<DD>using the X window system (requires X, not recommended for gateways)</DD>
</DL>
<P>Any of these wiil do the job. If you have no established preference,
 we suggest trying<VAR> menuconfig</VAR>.</P>
<P>For more information on configuring your kernel, see our<A href="kernel.html">
 section</A> on that topic.</P>
<H3><A name="inst-test">Install and test a kernel before adding
 FreeS/WAN</A></H3>
<P>You should compile, install and test the kernels as you have
 configured them, so that you have a known stable starting point. The
 series of commands involved is usually something like:</P>
<DL>
<DT>make menuconfig</DT>
<DD>choose kernel options, set up a kernel for your machine</DD>
<DT>make dep</DT>
<DD>find<STRONG> dep</STRONG>endencies between files</DD>
<DT>make bzImage</DT>
<DD>build a loadable kernel image, compressed with bzip(1)</DD>
<DT>make install</DT>
<DD>install it</DD>
<DT>make modules</DT>
<DD>build modules which can be added to a running kernel</DD>
<DT>make modules_install</DT>
<DD>install them</DD>
<DT>lilo</DT>
<DD>ensure that the boot loader sees your changes</DD>
</DL>
<P>Doing this first means that if there is a problem after you add
 FreeS/WAN, tracking it down is<EM> much</EM> simpler.</P>
<P>If you need advice on this process, or general Linux background
 information, try our<A href="web.html#linux.link"> Linux web references</A>
. The most directly relevant document is the<A href="http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html">
 Kernel HowTo</A>.</P>
<H2><A name="building">Building and installing the software</A></H2>
<P>There are several ways to build and install the software. All require
 that you have kernel source, correctly configured for your machine, as
 a starting point. If you don't have that yet, see the<A href="#before">
 previous section</A></P>
<P>Whatever method you choose, it will do all of the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>add FreeS/WAN code to the kernel
<UL>
<LI>insert patches into standard kernel code to provide an interface</LI>
<LI>add additional files which use that interface</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>re-configure and re-compile the kernel to activate that code</LI>
<LI>install the new kernel</LI>
<LI>build the non-kernel FreeS/WAN programs and install them
<UL>

<LI>install the initialisation script<VAR> /etc/rc.d/init.d/ipsec</VAR></LI>
<LI>create links to that script from the<VAR> /etc/rc.d/rc[0-6].d</VAR>
 directories so that each run level starts or stops IPsec. (If the
 previous sentence makes no sense to you, try the<A href="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/From-PowerUp-To-Bash-Prompt-HOWTO.html">
 From Power-up to Bash Prompt HowTo</A>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>You can do the whole install with two commands (recommended in most
 cases) or get into as much of the detail as you like.</P>
<H3><A name="build.rpm">Building RPMs</A></H3>
 As of version 1.93, we provide a facilty to build FreeS/WAN RPMs.
<P>Go to the FreeS/WAN directory and do whichever of the following
 commands you prefer:</P>
<DL>
<DT>make orpm</DT>
<DD>uses command-line kernel configuration</DD>
<DT>make menurpm</DT>
<DD>uses menu kernel configuration (requires ncurses library)</DD>
<DT>make xrpm</DT>
<DD>use X Window kernel configuration (requires X)</DD>
</DL>
<P>After the Makefile does the software and kernel build, it will make
 some RPMs and leave them in the<VAR> rpms</VAR> directory. The RPMs
 are:</P>
<DL>
<DT>freeswan</DT>
<DD>the userland utilities</DD>
<DT>freeswan-module</DT>
<DD>the ipsec.o kernel module, built only if your kernel configuration
 sets klips as a module</DD>
<DT>freeswan-kernel</DT>
<DD>the Linux kernel and its modules</DD>
<DT>freeswan-userkernel</DT>
<DD>all of the above</DD>
</DL>
<P>Once you have the RPMs, you can install FreeS/WAN from them with<VAR>
 rpm -i</VAR> commands. For a more detailed procedure, go to our<A href="quickstart.html">
 quickstart document</A>.</P>
<P>This makes it much easier to build FreeS/WAN on one system for
 installation on another.</P>
<P>This facility is based on work by Paul Lahaie at<A href="http://www.steamballoon.com">
 Steamballoon</A>.</P>
<H3><A name="build.module">Building IPsec as a module</A></H3>
<P>With the full procedure described in the<A href="#non-rpm"> next
 section</A>, you can either build the kernel parts of FreeS/WAN into
 your kernel or build them as a kernel module, depending on how you set
 the kernel configuration options.</P>
<P>Since 1.91, we also provide an option to build only the FreeS/WAN
 module, without re-compiling the rest of your kernel.</P>
<P>Note, however, that this requires:</P>
<UL>
<LI>kernel source in<VAR> /usr/src/linux</VAR></LI>
<LI>kernel has been configured</LI>
<LI>source matches the kernel you are actually running</LI>
</UL>
<P>To do the module install, give two commands in the FreeS/WAN
 directory:</P>
<UL>
<LI>one of<VAR> make omod</VAR>,<VAR> make menumod</VAR> or<VAR> make
 xmod</VAR></LI>
<LI><VAR>make minstall</VAR></LI>
</UL>
<P>You can now start FreeS/WAN with</P>
<PRE>service ipsec start</PRE>
<P>then choose<A href="#postinstall"> what to do next</A>.</P>
<P>N.B.: This is relatively new code and not yet tested on a wide range
 of systems. If it does not work for you, please report the problem. In
 the meanwhile, fall back to the older procedure described next..</P>
<H3><A name="non-rpm">Installing directly from source</A></H3>
 You can also install FreeS/WAN directly from the source, without
 building RPMs as an intermediate step.
<P>There are two steps here. First you do everything else, then you
 install the new FreeS/WAN-enabled kernel.</P>
<H4><A name="allbut">Everything but kernel installation</A></H4>
<P>To do everything except install the new kernel,<VAR> cd</VAR> into
 the freeswan directory and become root. Give<STRONG> any one</STRONG>
 of the following commands:</P>
<DL>
<DT>make oldgo</DT>
<DD>Uses FreeS/WAN's default settings for some kernel configuration
 options. Leaves all other options unchanged from your last kernel
 configuration.</DD>
<DT>make ogo</DT>
<DD>Invokes<VAR> config</VAR> so you can configure the kernel from the
 command line.</DD>
<DT>make menugo</DT>
<DD>Invokes<VAR> menuconfig</VAR> so you can configure the kernel with
 text-mode menus.</DD>
<DT>make xgo</DT>
<DD>Invokes<VAR> xconfig</VAR> so you can configure the kernel in an X
 window.</DD>
</DL>
<P>You must<STRONG> save the new configuration even if you make no
 changes</STRONG>. This ensures that the FreeS/WAN changes are actually
 seen by the system.</P>
<P>There are few options in the FreeS/WAN part of kernel configuration.
 For most of them, we recommend that you make no changes.</P>
<UL>
<LI>In particular,<STRONG> please do not disable FreeS/WAN debugging
 during kernel configuration</STRONG>. This code has no effect unless
 you turn it on with<VAR> klipsdebug</VAR> in your<A href="manpage.d/ipsec.conf.5.html">
 ipsec.conf(5)</A> file, and therefore no cost other than a modest
 increase in kernel size. However, if you disable it and then run into
 problems, we may not be able to help you.</LI>
<LI>One thing you can change is whether KLIPS is compiled into the
 kernel or as a module. The FreeS/WAN intialisation scripts work with
 either configuration, automatically loading the module if required, so
 it is your choice.</LI>
</UL>
<P> Our scripts save the output of<VAR> make</VAR> commands they call in
 files with names like<VAR> out.kbuild</VAR> or<VAR> out.kinstall</VAR>.
 The last command of each script checks the appropriate<VAR> out.*</VAR>

<UL>
<LI>If the last output you see is<VAR> make</VAR> saying it is calling

</UL>
<P>For the above commands, the error files are<VAR> out.kpatch</VAR> and<VAR>
 out.kbuild</VAR>.</P>
<P>These scripts automatically build an<A href="glossary.html#RSA"> RSA</A>
 authentication key pair (a public key and the matching private key) for
 you, and put the result in<VAR> /etc/ipsec.secrets</VAR>. For
 information on using RSA authentication, see our<A href="config.html">
 configuration section</A>. Here, we need only note that generating the

 randomness,<STRONG> it will block until it has enough input</STRONG>.
 You may need to provide input by moving the mouse around a lot, or
 going to another window and typing random characters, or using some
 command such as<VAR> du -s /usr</VAR> to generate disk activity.</P>
<H4><A name="newk">Installing the new kernel</A></H4>
<P>To install the kernel the easy way, just give this command in the

<DL>
<DT>make kinstall</DT>
<DD>Installs the new kernel and, if required, the modules to go with it.

<UL>
<LI>make</LI>
<LI>make install</LI>
<LI>make modules</LI>
<LI>make modules_install</LI>

<P>If you prefer that sequence, use it instead.</P>
<P>Reboot to enable your new FreeS/WAN-enabled kernel.</P>
<P>If you have some unusual setup such that the above sequence of

<DD>Download and untar the new kernel source. Since this kernel is not

<H4><A name="disable">Disabling FreeS/WAN</A></H4>
<P>In many Linux distributions, you can easily disable FreeS/WAN with
 the command:</P>
<PRE>    chkconfig --del ipsec</PRE>
<P>This removes the symlinks in<VAR> /etc/rc.d/rc?.d</VAR> which cause<VAR>
 ipsec(8)</VAR> to be called at boot time or when switching run levels.
 If the kernel part of IPsec,<A href="glossary.html#KLIPS"> KLIPS</A>,
 has been compiled as a module, then this also prevents loading that
 module, so IPsec is completely disabled.</P>
<P>Other distributions may use another version of<VAR> init(8)</VAR>, or
 may not provide the<VAR> chkconfig(8)</VAR> command. For these, you
 will have to use other tools, or manually edit the init scripts, to
 achieve the same effect.</P>
<H4><A name="remove.files">Removing FreeS/WAN files</A></H4>
<P>If you installed FreeS/WAN from RPMs, then just use<VAR> rpm -e</VAR>
 to uninstall it. This section is for those who have installed from
 source.</P>
<P>To entirely remove the user-level FreeS/WAN components from your
 system, go to the FreeS/WAN install directory and give the command:</P>
<PRE>     make uninstall_freeswan</PRE>
<P>If that doesn't work for you -- for example, if FreeS/WAN was built
 on another system and copied here -- then you can do it manually. First
 disable FreeS/WAN as described above (to avoid problems with symlinks
 pointing to things you are about to remove), and then use these
 commands:</P>
<PRE>        rm -f /etc/ipsec.* /usr/local/sbin/ipsec /etc/rc.d/init.d/ipsec
        rm -rf /usr/local/lib/ipsec
        rm -f /usr/local/man/man?/ipsec[._]*</PRE>
<P> You may need to vary the commands slightly if you, or whoever
 packaged your distribution, changed the install directories when
 building FreeS/WAN.</P>
<H4><A name="remove.kernel">Removing FreeS/WAN from the kernel</A></H4>
<P>If you compiled<A href="glossary.html#KLIPS"> KLIPS</A> as a module,
 then just disabling FreeS/WAN as described<A href="#disable"> above</A>
 prevents loading the module.</P>
<P>If<A href="glossary.html#KLIPS"> KLIPS</A> is compiled into your
 kernel, then you can disable it by turning off IPsec in your kernel
 configuration (or by making it a module) and recompiling.</P>
<P>You can remove the FreeS/WAN patches from your kernel source by going
 to the FreeS/WAN install directory and giving the command:</P>
<PRE>     make unpatch</PRE>
<P>This does not remove all FreeS/WAN changes; some are not done with
 patch(1) and cannot be reversed in this way.</P>
<P>To remove all trace of IPsec in your kernel, you should revert to an
 unpatched version, or download fresh kernel source.</P>
