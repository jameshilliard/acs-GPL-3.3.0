<H1><A name="interop">Interoperation with other IPsec implementations</A>
</H1>
<P>The IPsec protocols are designed to allow interoperation between
 different implementations. Other sections of this documentation have
 more detail on:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the IPsec<A href="ipsec.html"> protocol specifications</A></LI>
<LI>parts of the protocols<A href="compat.html#spec"> implemented or
 omitted</A> in FreeS/WAN</LI>
<LI><A href="web.html#implement">other implementations</A></LI>
</UL>
<P>FreeS/WAN does interoperate successfully with many other
 implementations. The ones we know about are listed<A href="#mail.interop">
 below</A>.</P>
<P>Of course &quot;the devil is in the details&quot; and the IPsec protocols have
 a lot of details. At least one<A href="http://www.counterpane.com/ipsec.pdf">
 critique</A> has argued that the protocols should be simplified.
 Various of those details can and do cause difficulties for
 interoperation. Should you encounter such problems, please let us know
 via the<A href="mail.html"> mailing list</A>. We will likely be able to
 help you, and your report may be useful both to other users and to the
 implementation teams.</P>
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> This file is updated often, whenever I notice
 an interesting interop report on the mailing list. If you are reading
 the version that ships with a FreeS/WAN release or is posted on the
 web, and what you need isn't here, consider downloading the latest
 snapshot to get the latest version of the doc. Perhaps I've added what
 you need since the last release.</P>
<P>There is additional information on interoperability testing in our<A href="web.html#interop.web">
 web links</A> section.</P>
<H2><A name="interop.problem">Interoperability problems</A></H2>
<P>The IPsec RFCs are complex and include a number of optional features.
 There is considerable opportunity for even two correct,
 standard-conforming, implementations to disagree on details in a way
 that blocks interoperation. Errors in either implementation -- either
 misinterpretations of the standards or just bugs -- can also foul
 things up.</P>
<P>The commonest cause of problems, however, seems to be configuration
 errors. Any IPsec implementation is somewhat complex. It has to be;
 neither the networks it runs on nor the protocols it implements are
 simple. When you have two of them to deal with, the problem you face is
 not trivial.</P>
<P>That said, FreeS/WAN interoperates successfully with many other
 implementations. There is a<A href="#mail.interop"> list</A> below,
 with configuration details provided by various users who have already
 solved these problems.</P>
<H3><A name="req.features">Possible problem areas</A></H3>
<P>Known areas where problems may appear are:</P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>FreeS/WAN does not implement single DES</STRONG> because<A href="politics.html#desnotsecure">
 DES is insecure</A>. Suggestions on what to do if the device you want
 to talk to has only DES are<A href="#noDES"> below</A>.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>FreeS/WAN does not implement Diffie-Hellman group 1
 (768-bit)</STRONG> because it is not clear that this is secure.</LI>
<LI>The RFCs define two modes for IKE negotiations -- main mode and
 aggressive mode. Aggressive mode is slightly faster, but reveals more
 information to an eavesdropper. Specifically, it lets an eavesdropper
 know what identities are in use.<STRONG> FreeS/WAN does not implement
 aggressive mode</STRONG>, so any negotiation another implementation
 tries that way will fail.</LI>
<P>In principle this should not be a problem since main mode support is
 required in all implementations and aggressive mode is optional. In
 practice, it is sometimes a problem. Some implementations default to
 aggressive mode unless you configure them for main mode.</P>
<LI>For automatic keying,<STRONG> the FreeS/WAN default is to provide<A href="glossary.html#PFS">
 perfect forward secrecy</A></STRONG>. We see no reason not to; this is
 more secure and costs little. Some other implementations, however, turn
 PFS off by default.</LI>
<P><STRONG>The PFS settings on the two ends must match</STRONG>. There
 is no provision in the protocol for negotiating whether to use PFS; you
 need to either set both ends to use it or set them both not to. For
 communication between FreeS/WAN and an implementation that has PFS off
 by default, you will have to change the setting on one end.</P>
<P>You can turn PFS off in FreeS/WAN with the<VAR> pfs=no</VAR> setting
 in<A href="manpage.d/ipsec.conf.5.html"> ipsec.conf(5)</A>, but if
 possible we suggest you enable PFS on the other end instead. That is
 more secure.</P>
<LI>The IKE protocol allows several types of optional message. Two
 things happen which are allowed by the RFCs:
<UL>
<LI>Some implementations send various optional messages.</LI>
<LI>FreeS/WAN ignores them.</LI>
</UL>
 However, problems may arise if the other end relies on some expected
 effect of these messages. There are two FAQ questions dealing with
 this, one on the<A href="faq.html#ignore"> log message</A> FreeS/WAN
 gives when ignoring optional payloads and one on the<A href="faq.html#deadtunnel">
 delete SA</A> payload.</LI>
<LI>IKE also allows an optional &quot;commit bit&quot; to be set on some messages.
 Some uses of this, especially by Windows 2000, have caused
 interoperation problems with FreeS/WAN. As of version 1.92, we have
 changed our handling of this -- we now ignore the bit instead of
 dropping the packet -- which should reduce such problems.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The general rule is that to interoperate with FreeS/WAN, the other
 implementation should be configured for:</P>
<UL>
<LI>main mode</LI>
<LI>triple DES encryption</LI>
<LI>Diffie-Hellman Group 2 (1024-bit) or Group 5 (1536-bit)</LI>
<LI>Perfect Forward Secrecy</LI>
</UL>
<P>This is possible for most implementations.</P>
<P>For a more detailed discussion of which parts of the IPsec
 specification FreeS/WAN implements, and reasons for that, see our<A href="compat.html#spec">
 compatibility document</A>.</P>
<H3><A NAME="10_1_2">Documentation and terminology problems</A></H3>
<P>Documentation can also pose problems for interoperation. The two
 implementations may use different terms for the same thing, or one may
 have features that the other does not support and therefore does not
 document. This can be quite confusing for the poor user who has to deal
 with both.</P>
<P>Known examples are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>What I call a &quot;shared secret&quot; (e.g. in<A href="adv_config.html#prodsecrets">
 this section</A>), the documentation for another implementation might
 call a &quot;passphrase&quot; or&nbsp;&quot;pre-shared key&quot;.</LI>
<LI>Some implementations specify a subnet as a range of IP addresses,
 for example 192.168.1.0-192.168.1.255 where we would use a subnet mask,
 e.g. 192.168.1.0/24 or 192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0. See our<A href="adv_config.html#subnet.size">
 discussion of subnets</A>.</LI>
</UL>
<P>If you encounter such problems, please report them to the<A href="mail.html">
 users mailing list</A> and I'll try to add some clarifying text on the
 FreeS/WAN side.</P>
<H3><A name="one-way">If it only works in one direction</A></H3>
<P>A few users have encountered situations in which interoperation is
 fine when one end initiates, but fails if the other end starts the
 negotiation.</P>
<P>In such cases, you can set<VAR> rekey=no</VAR> in the FreeS/WAN
 connection description. This prevents FreeS/WAN from initiating
 re-keying of that connection, but it will still respond if the partner
 initiates.</P>
<P>Even if that trick solves your problem, please report the difficulty
 to the<A href="mail.html"> users mailing list</A>. It is definitely
 supposed to work no matter who initiates.</P>
<H3><A name="client.server">&quot;Clients&quot; and &quot;servers&quot;</A></H3>
 IPsec is not a client/server protocol. In a client/server protocol, the
 two ends have quite different roles. For example, consider the web. The
 client runs a browser and mostly does display. The server runs
 completely different software and does no display at all. Similarly, in
 a database application, the client and server play quite different
 roles and often run completely different software.
<P>IPsec is a peer-to-peer protocol. The gateways on the two ends of an
 IPsec connection are peers, both doing the same thing. They could use
 identical software.</P>
<P>Despite this, various vendors produce products they call &quot;clients&quot;
 and others they call &quot;servers&quot;. Typically, the &quot;clients&quot; do not support
 a subnet behind them. They are designed only to let a single remote
 machine connect. To get full IPsec with subnet support, you pay more
 for the &quot;server version&quot;.</P>
<P>For example, the free version of<A href="#pgpnet"> PGPnet</A> is only
 a &quot;client&quot;; for subnet support you need to purchase the product. Also,
 Windows 2000 Professional has only &quot;client&quot; IPsec. For subnet support
 you need to purchase the server version, or put Linux and FreeS/WAN on
 your gateways.</P>
<P>This difference does not cause interoperation problems as such.
 FreeS/WAN will happily interoperate with either a &quot;client&quot; or a
 &quot;server&quot; product, and will happily play either role itself, depending
 on how it is configured. In their marketing terms, FreeS/WAN acts as a
 &quot;server&quot; if you define a subnet behind the gateway, and as a &quot;client&quot;
 if you do not.</P>
<P>It does, however, often complicate things when users discover that
 the product they have will not do what they need because it is &quot;only a
 client&quot;. Usually the only solutions are to upgrade to the &quot;sever
 version&quot; or to switch to a different product.</P>
<H3><A name="noDES">Systems that want to use single DES</A></H3>
<P>Linux FreeS/WAN does not support single DES transforms. Neither
 Pluto's IKE connections nor KLIPS' IPsec connections can use DES. Since<A
href="politics.html#desnotsecure"> DES is insecure</A> we do not, and
 will not at any future time, provide it.</P>
<P>DES is, unfortunately, a mandatory part of the<A href="glossary.html#IPsec">
 IPsec</A> standard. Despite that, we will not implement DES. We believe
 it is more important to provide security than to comply with a standard
 which has been<A href="politics.html#weak"> subverted</A> into allowing
 weak algorithms. See our<A href="politics.html"> history and politics</A>
 section for discussion.</P>
<P>Some implementations may offer DES as the default. In such cases we
 urge you to change them to<A href="glossary.html#3DES"> Triple DES</A>.
 If this is not possible, for example because<A href="politics.html#exlaw">
 export laws</A> prevent your vendor from offerring you adequate
 crytography, we urge you to complain vigorously to one or more of:</P>
<UL>
<LI>your government, especially any department concerned with protecting
 citizens' privacy or your nation's communication infrastructure</LI>
<LI>the vendor</LI>
<LI>the embassy of the nation whose laws are problematic for you</LI>
</UL>
<P>Consider using FreeS/WAN instead. PCs are cheap and we deliver 3DES
 now.</P>
<P>FreeS/WAN does have<A href="glossary.html#DES"> DES</A> code in it as
 a sort of historical accident, since we need it to implement our
 default (currently, our only) block cipher,<A href="glossary.html#3DES">
 Triple DES</A>. However, since<A href="politics.html#desnotsecure"> DES
 is insecure</A>, we do not provide any interface to that code.</P>
<P>As a matter of project policy, we will not help anyone subvert
 FreeS/WAN to provide<A href="politics.html#desnotsecure"> insecure DES
 encryption</A>.</P>
<H2><A name="patch.interop">Patches to extend interoperability</A></H2>
<P>Sometimes interoperation requires user-contributed patches or add-ons
 on the FreeS/WAN end. See this<A href="web.html#patch"> list of
 available patches</A>.</P>
<P>In many cases, no patches to the actual IPsec code are required. The
 problem is to make FreeS/WAN recognise RSA keys stored in formats other
 than ours. Each such format needs either a patch to make FreeS/WAN
 understand that format or a utility to translate it to the FreeS/WAN
 format. For example, unmodified FreeS/WAN cannot use RSA keys generated
 by<A href="glossary.html#PGP"> PGP</A> or keys stored in<A href="glossary.html#X.509">
 X.509</A> certificates, but patches or utilities are available for both
 those formats.</P>
<P>Other patches do change the IPsec code, for example to add the<A href="glossary.html">
 AES</A> cipher. Likely this patch will be incorporated into FreeS/WAN
 long before AES becomes important as an interoperaibility issue.</P>
<P>Note that with some patches, you might be giving up some security in
 exchange for interoperability. There are a number of &quot;features&quot; of
 IPsec which we do not implement (<A href="compat.html#dropped">details</A>
) either because they directly reduce security or because they
 unnecessarily complicate things, thereby adding to security risks.
 Adding these &quot;features&quot; is not recommended..</P>
<H2><A name="otherpub">Interop HowTo documents</A></H2>
<P>The FreeS/WAN team does not have the resources to test with anything
 like the full range of<A href="web.html#implement"> other IPsec
 implementations</A> out there. Fortunately, some of our users are doing
 a fine job of filling the gap by providing HowTo information:</P>

<P>From a mailing list report:</P>
<PRE>     Subject: IPsec 2001 interop demo data available
        Date: Tue, 13 Nov 2001
        From: Ghislaine Labouret &lt;Ghislaine.Labouret@hsc.fr&gt;
Organization: HSC (Herve Schauer Consultants)

During the IPsec 2001 conference held in Paris last month, an
interoperability demonstration including FreeS/WAN was set up.

FreeS/WAN 1.91 + X.509 patch 0.9.3 was tested with the following
devices: 6WINDGate, Cisco IOS, Cisco PIX, Cisco VPN 3000, Netasq F100,
Netcelo VPN gateway, NetScreen NS100, Nortel Contivity, OpenBSD 3.0.

The results and configuration files are now available online:

<P>Most of the information in this section is gleaned from the mailing

<P>A large thank you is in order to all the list contributors. This

<H3><A name="oldswan">Older versions of FreeS/WAN</A></H3>
 Any two versions of FreeS/WAN should interoperate, and many
 combinations have been tested doing so successfully. In particular,
 every release is tested against its predecessor before it goes out.
<P>However, if you do encounter a problem involving an older version, we
 are likely to suggest you upgrade. We do not have the resources to
 support multiple versions.</P>
<H4><A name="config.old">Using your old config files</A></H4>
<P>In general, new versions will use existing configuration files, at
 least until the next major version number change. For example, 1.8 can
 use files created for 1.7, 1.6, even back to 1.0, but not from 0.92.
 This behaviour will continue until we release 2.0.</P>
<P>As of 1.8, however, conf file checking has become stricter, so that
 an error that may have slipped past the checks in an earlier version
 may be caught in a later one. From 1.8's doc/CHANGES:</P>
<PRE>      The internal configuration-file reader is progressively getting 
      fussier about what it will accept, which may cause problems for 
      illegal ipsec.conf files whose sins previously passed unnoticed.  
      IN PARTICULAR, the &quot;auto&quot; parameter's values are now checked for 
      legality everywhere.</PRE>

PS.  I don't know if you have an interop list anywhere, but you should
know FreeS/WAN interops with OpenBSD both at the IPSec level and at
the IKE level.</PRE>
<P>There is one known problem with FreeS/WAN-OpenBSD IKE interoperation.
 Here is a mailing message from our Pluto implementer, discussing that
 with the user who discovered it:</P>
<PRE>Subject: Re: [Bugs] Interoperability with OpenBSD
   Date: Sun, 30 Sep 2001

| Yes, the problem was the pre-shared key.  It seems that it cannot be
| more than 64 characters long.  I was using a longer key.
|
| Is this documented behaviour for either FreeS/WAN or isakmpd?  (Anyway
| a reasonable error message would not hurt.)

The limit is not in FreeS/WAN, so we don't document it :-)

I guess we could mention this on our interop pages.  Claudia?

The error message from isakmpd was not very helpful (I realize that
I'm in a glass house when I throw this stone).

- isamkpd documentation should state the limit

- isakmpd should diagnose that the PSK was too long

- isakmpd should suggest that this type of problem (undigestable
  message) might be caused by mis-matched PSK

I hope that you would have gotten a better message from Pluto.  So if
you had initiated from the isakmpd side, the resulting diagnostic from
Pluto might have lead you to the problem more quickly.

When Pluto cannot parse the first encrypted IKE message, it prints a
diagnosis of the parse failure (just like isakmpd did), but it prefixes it
with
        probable authentication (preshared secret) failure:

I just noticed that it will print this even if authentication is via
RSA Sig -- I will fix that.  I'll reword the prefix too:
        probable authentication failure (mismatch of preshared secrets?):</PRE>

&gt; FreeBSD:
&gt; 
&gt; For FreeBSD, I find list discussion of 3DES key formats, presumably for manual
&gt; keying. We have 192-bit, 3 64-bit keys including parity bits, while FreeBSD 4.0
&gt; used 168-bit, 3 56-bit keys without the parity bits. Has FreeBSD changed this?

I still don't understand what made Spike Gronim say that KAME wants a
168 bits key; I have always been using 192 bits keys with KAME and had
no interoperability problem between KAME and FreeS/WAN using manual
keying.

&gt; For auto keying, I find reports of sucessful use of pre-shared secrets, but
&gt; nothing on RSA authentication.

I had KAME (20001023 snapshot) and FreeS/WAN 1.6 successfully
interoperate using both PSK and RSA-sig authentication. The config
files, certificates and test keys used are available online:
http://www.hsc.fr/ipsec/ipsec2000/kame/
http://www.hsc.fr/ipsec/ipsec2000/freeswan/
Not much details though, as this is just a report and not a how-to. Will
improve it if I can find spare time.

&gt; Does FreeBSD support that? 

KAME can use RSA-sig and can either exchange certificates online or get
them from a file. I tested the latter. No test with the X.509 patch for
FreeS/WAN yet, though that's in my short term plans too.

&gt; Are the key formats compatible, or has anyone written translation code?

KAME wants the keys inside certificates, in PEM format. To extract the
keys for FreeS/WAN I used the fswcert utility, but it can be done &quot;by
hand&quot; using openssl.</PRE>

   Date: Fri, 31 Aug 2001 
   From: mcferren@colltech.com

I finally got a vpn linked up between a 3000 series cisco router and a
redhat linux box using shared secrets.  The linux box is running 2.2.19 with
freeswan 1.9. The shared secret has no spaces in it, as I read somewhere
that it might break the connection.

Several people have asked me the configuration that I have used to
make this happen, so I thought I should publish it here.  

Here is the network...

access-list 130 permit ip 10.25.5.0 0.0.0.255 172.11.251.0 0.0.0.255

Sorry it took so long to send this out, but there is apparently an ipchains
firewall on the host behind the cisco, and it took some time to get
these rules straight.

I hope this helps someone....</PRE>

<P>A message from another user about using RSA keys with Cisco:</P>
<PRE>From: jrussi@uol.com.br
Subject: Re: [Users] RSA public key and Cisco (3640)
Date: Sat, 2 Jun 2001

We use Cisco IOS 12.1.5(T) and freeswan 1.8

Here an example on how I copied the key from cisco:

Key Data:
  117C311E 16192D86 8886C71D 11111115 11138B11 31881241 11C7E23B D6DB22 
  18DEC1BD....

Will become

0x117C311E16192D868886C71D1111111511138B113188124111C7E23BD6DB2218DEC1BD...  

We used at least 1024 bits long keys.

But it doesn&acute;t matter. The problem is that cisco doesn&acute;t agree with the RSA
schema from freeswan, I think. In Cisco, rsasig is to use with a CA, and
rsaencript did not work as well. 

My case is worse than it. My first intention was to use freeswan in a road
warrior config. I really need to use CA, as Cisco needs a fix address to
use rsa public key. The public key to cisco is always associated to an IP
address ou FQDN. I quit. Will try the X509 patch and the Open CA software.

Deyvi
&gt;&gt;(off list)
&gt;
&gt;Yes, I was just going to mention that the Cisco's key should be in
&gt;ipsec.conf (just received your correction).
&gt;
&gt;I think that I have the Cisco side configured correctly ( I can't be sure
&gt;because I can't test against the Freeswan).
&gt;
&gt;Starting from having the IPsec tunnel working with pre-share, I did the
&gt;following on the Cisco side:
&gt;
&gt;#config t
&gt;(config)# crypto key pubkey-chain rsa
&gt;(config-pubkey-chain)# addressed-key 
<!--ipaddress of freeswan-->

&gt;(config-pubkey-key)# key-string
&gt;(config-pubkey-key)# 
<!--paste freeswan key here-->

&gt;(config-pubkey-key)#quit
&gt;(config-pubkey-chain)#exit
&gt;
&gt;# config t
&gt;(config)# crypto isakmp policy 1
&gt;(config-isakmp)# no authentication pre-share
&gt;(config-isakmp)# authentication rsa-sig
&gt;(config-isakmp)# exit
&gt;
&gt;How long is your RSA key that was generated on the Cisco? I tried copying
&gt;the key out of the 3640 and pasting it into ipsec.conf, removing the spaces
&gt;and adding a '0x' in the front. I get the 'key too small' error still. What
&gt;version of freeswan are you using?
&gt;
&gt;I'm using Freeswan 1.9 w/ IOS 12.1(6).</PRE>

i have to establish a vpn tunnel between two companies.
one of the company is using the cisco vpn concentrator
and the other company is using redhat 7.1 and freeswan.

it is no a problem to estblish the tunnel between two freeswan
gateways or between a cisco vpn-client and the concentrator.

but the companies don't want to change their equipment.
and with this constellation i can't establish the tunnel.

the responce from cisco is: &quot;THAT IS NOT SUPPORTED&quot;

With VPN3000, we had a problem with the DN comparison because of

<P>There is one known issue in FreeS/WAN-to-Contivity interoperation.

More interoperability results:

I successfully established a tunnel with a Nortel (formerly Bay (formerly New Oak)) Contivity
Extranet Switch running the latest release versions.

The CES is running V2.50 of the software and the Linux server is running V1.0.0 of the Free/SWAN
code on a RedHat 5.2 unit with the kernel upgraded to 2.0.36-3

I am using IKE with 3DES-HMAC-MD5

Note however, that tunnels cannot yet be configured as client tunnels since Free/SWAN does not yet
support aggressive mode.  Hopefully, that will arrive soon, which would allow remote users to
connect to a CES using the Free/SWAN code as clients.</PRE>

Nortel's Contivity IPsec server has a formal policy of interoperability
with FreeS/WAN.   I was quite pleased to hear it when they last talked to us,
and it makes sense in their business environment, since they let you use
their WinXX client software free, so this gives them support for Linux

OK, here is a very brief nuts and bolts breakdown on how to get this
combo working.  I want to thank everyone at Free-S/WAN and everyone on
the list for your help in getting this to work.

Connecting FreeS/WAN to the Nortel Networks Contivity Extranet Switch:

What you need:
FreeS/WAN v1.5 and Contivity ver 2.5 - 3.5 (might work with earlier
versions, but I have not tested it with this config)
or
FreeS/WAN v1.8 and COntivity ver 3.5 (the 3.5 version supports Diffe
Hilman group 2 key exchange)

What to do:
1 - Configure the Contivity:
   Set up a branch office tunnel group with the following settings:
        
        Connectivity:
        Nailed Up: Disabled
        Access Hours: Anytime
        Call Admission Priority: Highest Priority
        Forwarding Priority: Low Priority
        Idle Timeout: 00:00:00
        Forced Logoff: 00:00:00
        RSVP: Disabled
        RSVP: Token Bucket Depth: 3000 Bytes
        RSVP: Token Bucket Rate: 28 Kbps
        Branch Office Bandwidth Policy: 
        - Committed Rate: 56 Kbps
        - Excess Rate: 128 Kbps
        - Excess Action: Mark

        Encryption: 
        - ESP - Triple DES with SHA1 Integrity: Enabled
        - ESP - Triple DES with MD5 Integrity: Enabled
        - ESP - 56-bit DES with SHA1 Integrity: Disabled
        - ESP - 56-bit DES with MD5 Integrity: Disabled
        *IKE Encryption and Diffie-Hellman Group: Triple DES with Group
2 (1024-bit prime)
        Vendor ID: Disabled
        Perfect Forward Secrecy: Enabled
        Compression: Disabled
        Rekey Timeout: 08:00:00
        Rekey Data Count:  (None) 
        *ISAKMP Retransmission Interval: 16
        *ISAKMP Retransmission Max Attempts: 4

        Set up a branch office tunnel inside this new group with the
following settings:
        
        Endpoint Addresses
        Local - Public address of your COntivity
        Remote - Your Free-S/WAN interface Address
                Tunnel Type - IPSEC
        IPSEC Authentication - Text Pre-Shared Key
                One note here, I have had some trouble trying to use HEX
or Non alphanumeric chars in this key.
        
        Under IP:
        Static Routing
        Local - networks you want to be able to access through the
tunnel
        Remote - networks that will be allowed through the tunnel
        NAT - None

   Get routing setup on your office network:
        You will need to get a routing entry that will point all traffic
bound for your home network (the one that will be acciessible through
the tunnel) to the internal interface of the contivity system.

   Configure Free-S/WAN:
        Install, compile, and test Free-S/WAN
        Edit ipsec.conf for your new tunnel:

<P>A mailing list suggestion from FreeS/WAN technical lead Henry
 Spencer:</P>
<PRE>&gt; In the Raptor settings, there are 2 sets of data (1 for each end). Each set
&gt; contains an SPI, 3 DES Keys and 1 MD5 hash. I only know how to include one
&gt; set, how do I include the other set? Is the other set needed?

They may be using different keys for each direction, which is a bit
unusual for manual keying, but not impossible.  The simplest thing is
probably to just give it two identical sets of data -- that should work.
FreeS/WAN has provisions for asymmetric keys etc. in manual keying, but
that stuff is lightly documented and lightly tested.</PRE>

Hugh,

&gt; Good.  But we don't think that you should be using our IPCOMP just
&gt; yet.  It is flaky :-(

I've seen no anomalies, although &quot;allow ipcomp&quot; is on at the Gauntlet 
end.  Looking at my ipsec.conf I actually find no refereence to ipcomp. 
 I presume it is disabled by default.  In addition, reviewing my logs 
both on the Gauntlet end and the Linux end, I see nothing I can 
interpret as an indication that ipcomp was enabled during negotiation.  
So I have to correct my previous posting - I believe the link is *not* 
using ipcomp.

&gt; This is interesting and we'd love a more complete writeup.  It should
&gt; get incorporated into our interop documentation.

Here are the relevant bits from ipsec.conf:

config setup
        interfaces=%defaultroute
        klipsdebug=none
        plutodebug=none
        plutoload=%search
        plutostart=%search
        uniqueids=yes

conn freeswan17-gauntlet55
        auto=start
        type=tunnel
        left=1.1.1.1
        leftnexthop=1.1.1.2
        leftsubnet=10.0.1.0/24
        right=3.3.3.3
        rightnexthop=3.3.3.4
        rightsubnet=10.0.2.0/24
        authby=secret
        keyexchange=ike
        ikelifetime=480m
        auth=esp
        esp=3des-md5-96
        keylife=480m
        keyingtries=8
        pfs=no
        rekeymargin=9m
        rekeyfuzz=25%

All settings on the Gauntlet side are the same (not shown here, as GUI 
screenshots are hard to show in ASCII... and the textual format that is 
generated by the Gauntlet GUI is ugly in the extreme).

Note that ikelifetime is 1440m by default on the Gauntlet end, but 
freeswan does not support this value (max appears to be 480m), thus the 
Gauntlet end is also set to 480m to match freeswan's value.

Also worth noting: I am using the excellent Seawall scripts to manage 
ipchains configuration on the freeswan end.  It automatically generates 
a correct set of firewall rules for the link (along with doing many 
other convenient things).</PRE>

   Date: Tue, 6 Feb 2001
   From: Claudia Schmeing &lt;claudia@freeswan.org&gt;
 
&gt; Thanx to Michael and Claudia, but this doesn't work from VPN1 to linux (as
&gt; linux to VPN1 is OK).
...

&gt; I think that VPN1 doesn't send &quot;192.168.1.0/24&quot; but &quot;192.168.1.20/32&quot; and,
&gt; as Claudia said, IPSEC SA need to match Exactly. 

I don't know about the rules on the VPN-1. You'll have to rely on people 
with applicable experience there...

&gt; Is it possible that freeswan doesn't do the inclusion process (ie if he
&gt; receive 192.168.1.20/32, i doesn't match that this is include in
&gt; 192.168.1.0/24) ?

Yes, that's correct. It needs to match exactly, and inclusion is not
part of this process.
 
&gt; Btw why VPN/1 send 192.168.1.20/32 and not 192.168.1.20/24 (the value that
&gt; Freeswan is waiting for)? A bug?

I think Michael may be able to help you with this.

&gt; Have i a way to force Freeswan to do the &quot;inclusion&quot; (ie accept 
&gt; 192.168.1.20/32 as a part of 192.160.1.20/24, even if the 2 IPSEC Sa 
&gt; doesn't match exactly) ?

No, but...
Another strategy is to accept the fact that the Checkpoint 
proposes separate connections for each machine. If you define 
and add each of these connections on the Linux FreeS/WAN side, then 
Linux FreeS/WAN ought to accept the Checkpoint's proposals.

The only possible difficulty with this strategy is that I don't know 
how Linux FreeS/WAN handles the concept of overlapping tunnels. I
believe, though, that these tunnels can coexist, and if for any 
packet there are two options, a more general and a less general, the
packet will be handled by the more specific tunnel. You would need
to do a little testing to ensure you understand the behaviour and
that this does actually solve your problem.

I think it would be simplest to try to get the Checkpoint to propose the 
more general tunnel. Since I don't recall having seen this problem before, 
I suspect the simpler solution is doable.</PRE>

Hello, FreeS/WAN community !

SSH Communications Security Corp has released a new public beta #3
version of SSH Sentinel VPN client for Windows. We've got a lot of
reports also from FreeS/WAN community and with that feedback we've
improved interoperability and stability. 

For example PFS (Perfect Forward Secrecy in IKE rekey) can now be used
between SSH Sentinel and FreeSWAN, and if using that user contributed
X.509 patch and exporting the certificate from SSH Sentinel, now those
-----[BEGIN|END] CERTIFICATE----- headers/footers are properly included
in the exported PEM formatted certificate, so it can be imported to
FreeSWAN with fswcert utility and OpenSSL tools. 

Thank you a lot for your feedback, colleagues !

You can get that new public beta #3 and PDF formatted User Manual from
ftp://ftp.ssh.com/pub/sentinel/ or via website
http://www.ipsec.com/products/sentinel/beta/register.html

For more information about the product, please check our website

In current SSH Sentinel release you can select 'Legacy proposal' option, 
  when setting up a VPN Connection profile. That causes it to use 3DES 
as a default cipher and DES as a alternative one. The option was added 
there just to improve interoperability with legacy systems supporting 
3DES or even DES only.

If no selecting Legacy Proposal option, SSH Sentinel sends quite a huge 
proposal list to the responder to find automatically one common cipher 
supported to be used for the connection. That proposal list is known to 
be problematic for some VPN gateway implementations like FreeSWAN. 
Typically the long proposal list itself may the a problem or fragmented 
packets of the long proposal list may be a probem.

Now we've been living in a world of DES and 3DES, but hopefully in a 
near future the use of AES/Rijndael will increase. ...</PRE>

<PRE>Subject: FreeS/WAN and WatchGuard Firebox interop
   Date: Mon, 18 Dec 2000
   From: Max Enders &lt;menders@watchguard.com&gt;

I was recently given the task of testing IPSec interoperability
with our product, the Firebox. I just wanted to let you know that
I had success with a manual keyed tunnel. Here's what I used for
my test:

RedHat Linux 6.2
Linux 2.2.18 i686 unknown
Linux FreeS/WAN 1.8
&quot;Trusted&quot; interface: 192.168.0.1/24
&quot;External&quot; interface: 192.168.1.1/24

Firebox II FastVPN
WatchGuard Live Security System v4.5
Trusted interface: 192.168.2.1/24
External interface: 192.168.1.2/24

Because FreeS/WAN does not implement single DES, a dynamic keyed
tunnel will not work. Our product strictly uses DES for main mode.
We hope to address this in a future release. Here are instructions
for configuring the Firebox:

Open the Policy Manager and create a new IPSec gateway. Set the Key
Negotiation Type to manual and enter the FreeS/WAN box's external
IP address for the Remote Gateway IP. Configure a new tunnel with
a unique SPI. Select 3DES-CBC for Encryption and MD5-HMAC for
Authentication. Make an Encryption Key and Authentication Key.
Copy the values and save them for configuration of the FreeS/WAN box.
Configure a routing policy and any necessary services as you normally
would.

Here's how I configured FreeS/WAN:

Modifications to /etc/ipsec.conf:

Under the &quot;config setup&quot; section, add:

manualstart=firebox

At the end of the file, add the following connection:

conn firebox
left=192.168.1.1
leftsubnet=192.168.0.0/24
right=192.168.1.2
rightsubnet=192.168.2.0/24
spi=0x101
esp=3des-md5-96
espenckey=0x515b0875793e3708517c3d4554012f7c0273375e51572a31
espauthkey=0x072649041c2c0d452f7c15407576522f

The spi used here should match the Firebox's. Note that the Policy Manager
expects an SPI in decimal, not hexadecimal. The espenckey value should be
0x and the Encryption Key you're using on the Firebox. Likewise for
espauthkey and the Authentication Key on the Firebox.</PRE>

It's working!!!

Voila...  I wish to thank all the FreeS/WAN for putting out such a great
product out!  And also Philippe PAULEAU who pioneered interoperability
between FreeS/WAN and Watchguard Firebox II and therefore showed me that my
efforts would not be wasted!...

Yes indeed FreeS/WAN to WatchGuard Firebox only works in manual keying mode
and the best way to generate keys is to have the firebox generate the keys,
then copy and paste into the ipsec.conf file on the FreeS/WAN side (don't
forget to prefix the keys with '0x' in your ipsec.conf file.

Also keep in mind that the SPI is in decimal on the Firebox side and HEX on
the FreeS/WAN side!!!  We spent 4 hours on fixing this HEX-DEC issue only :)</PRE>

I tested 0.92 against the Xedia Access Point/QVPN product, using
dynamic keying (i.e., Pluto at work).

Results: it works fine so long as you ask for 3DES.  DES and no-crypto 
modes don't work when Pluto is involved.

I did limited data testing, which seemed to be fine.  No performance
numbers yet, could do that if people are interested.

| OK, I'm stumped.  I am trying to configure IPSEC to support road

| 
| I've set up everything as per the man pages on the ipsec side.
| 
| I've set up everything on the PGPnet side per the docs for that package.

| Pluto fails with this:
| 
| Jan 16 08:14:11 aphrodite Pluto[26401]: &quot;homeusers&quot; #8: no acceptable

| 
| and then it terminates the connection.

As far as I can tell/remember, there are three common ways that PGPnet
and FreeS/WAN don't get along.

1. PGPnet proposes a longer lifetime for an SA than Pluto is willing
   to accept.

2. After rekeying (i.e. after building a new SA bundle because the old
   one is about to expire), FreeS/WAN immediately switches to the new
   one while PGPnet continues using the old

3. FreeS/WAN defaults to expecting Perfect Forward Secrecy and PGPnet
   does not.

Perhaps you are bumping into the first.  In any case, look back
in the log to see why Pluto rejected each transform</PRE>

<PRE>   Subject: Re: Secure Gate Fails- PGPNet &amp; FreeSwan
   Date: Wed, 28 Jun 2000
   From: Andreas Haumer &lt;andreas@xss.co.at&gt;

I have a PGPnet setup running with FreeS/WAN working as secure 
gateway. It works quite fine, except for a re-negotiation problem 
I'm currently investigating, and in fact I have it running on some
test equipment here right now!

As I tried _several_ different non-working configuration settings 
I think I know the exact _one_ which works... :-)

Here's my short &quot;HOWTO&quot;:

FreeS/WAN version: snap1000jun25b
PGPnet: PGP Personal Privacy, Version 6.5.3
Linux: 2.2.16 with some patches

Network setup:
=============

internal subnet [192.168.x.0/24]
|
|        [192.168.x.1]
secure gateway with FreeS/WAN
|        [a.b.c.x]
|
|        [a.b.c.y]
router to internet
|
|   Internet
|
|        [dynamically assigned IP address]
road-warrior with PGPnet


Configuration of FreeS/WAN:
==========================

a) /etc/ipsec.conf

config setup
        interfaces=%defaultroute
        klipsdebug=none
        plutodebug=none
        plutoload=%search
        plutostart=%search

conn %default
        keyingtries=1
        authby=secret
        left=a.b.c.x
        leftnexthop=a.b.c.y

conn gw-rw
        right=0.0.0.0
        auto=add

conn subnet-rw
        leftsubnet=192.168.x.0/24
        right=0.0.0.0
        auto=add                          


b) /etc/ipsec.secrets

a.b.c.x 0.0.0.0: &quot;my very secret secret&quot;   


Note: If you are running ipchains on your secure gateway,
you have to open the firewall for all the IPsec packets 
and also for traffic from your ipsec interface!
Don't masquerade the IPsec traffic!

Check your logfiles if the firewall is blocking some 
important packets!


Configuration of PGPnet:
=======================

(note that there is an excellent description, including
screenshots of PGPnet, on &lt;http://jixen.tripod.com/&gt;)

In short, do the following:

Launch the PGPnet configuration tool and set defaults options
=============================================================

Start - Program - PGP - PGPnet
View - Options
General Panel :
  Expert Mode
  Allow communications with unconfigured hosts
  Require valid authentication key
  Cache passphrases between logins
  IKE Duration : 6h
  IPsec : 6h
Advanced panel :
  Selected options :
    Ciphers : Tripple DES
    Hashes : MD5
    Diffie-Hellman : 1024 and 1536
    Compression : LZS and Deflate
  Make the IKE proposal :
    Shared-Key - MD5 - 3DES -1024 bits on top of the list (move up)
  Make the IPSec proposal :
    NONE - MD5-TrippleDES -NONE on top of the list (move up)
  Select Perfect Forward Secrecy = 1024 bits
Press OK


Create the connection's definition.
==================================

In the Hosts panel, ADD
  Name : Enter a name for the right gateway
  IPaddress : Enter its IP address visible to the internet (a.b.c.x)
  Select Secure Gateway
  Set shared Paraphrase : enter you preshared key
  Identity type : select IP address
  Identity : enter 0.0.0.0
  Remote Authentication : select Any valid key
Press Ok
  Select the newly created entry for the right gateway and click ADD,
YES
  Name : Enter a name for the central subnet
  IP address : Enter its network IP address (192.168.x.0)
  Select Insecure Subnet
  Subnet Mask : enter its subnetmask (255.255.255.0)
Press OK, YES, YES                             


This should be it. Note that with this configuration there is
still this re-keying problem: after 6 hours, the SA is expired
and the connection fails. You have to re-connect your connection
with PGPnet.</PRE>

It's likely related to this one, that you note on the site:

&gt;2. After rekeying (i.e. after building a new SA bundle because the old
&gt;   one is about to expire), FreeS/WAN immediately switches to the new
&gt;   one while PGPnet continues using the old

The issue is: When taking down and subsequently recreating a connection, 
it can appear to come up, but it is unusable because PGPNet continues
to use an old SA, which Linux FreeS/WAN no longer recognizes. The solution is
to take down the old connection using PGPNet, so that it will then
use the most recently generated SA.</PRE>

   Date: Sat, 16 Dec 2000
  From: &quot;Tim Wilson&quot; &lt;timwilson@mediaone.net&gt;

Here are some details about using the IRE SafeNet Soft/PK client with a
FreeSwan gateway.

I applied the x509 patch to Pluto according to the instructions. I use the
&quot;leftcert&quot; and &quot;rightcert&quot; keywords in the ipsec.conf file. This causes
FreeSwan to read the public keys and identities from the cert files. The
identities wanted and used by FreeSwan will then be the DNs in the certs.

I used OpenSSL to generate keys and certs and to sign certs. When generating
the gateway cert, you should *not* enter an e-mail address because it turns
out that confuses Soft/PK. Also, Andreas Steffan tells me that you want to
keep the cert short to avoid fragmentation, so use a 1024-bit RSA key and
succinct names.

The FreeSwan gateway cert goes in /etc/ipsec.d/, the gateway private key is
extracted from the key file using fswcert (part of the x509 patch) and
pasted into /etc/ipsec.secrets, and a DER version of the gateway cert goes
in /etc/x509cert.der. This is all according to the instructions that
accompany the x509 patch.

The Windows client is of course running Soft/PK in this case. I generated a
private key and cert for the client on the Linux machine using OpenSSL. I
created a pkcs12 file containing the client's private key and cert, which I
put on a floppy and imported into Soft/PK. I also imported the gateway cert
into Soft/PK (you can either import a self-signed cert for the gateway or
the self-signed cert for the CA that signed the gateway cert--either works).

Soft/PK allows you to configure practically everything for the connection.
Here are the main points to watch for:

On the first panel you have to set the peer identities. The gateway will
identify itself using the DN in the gateway cert. So of course you have to
configure Soft/PK to look for the correct DN. There's no problem with this
as long as you didn't enter an e-mail address in the gateway cert. Just
check &quot;Connect using Secure Gateway tunnel&quot;, set ID type to &quot;Distinguished
Name&quot;, and enter the correct info in the dialog box.

In &quot;My identity&quot; just select the client cert that you imported in pcks12
format. Soft/PK apparently identifies itself with the DN from the cert,
which is exactly what FreeSwan is looking for.

In &quot;Security Policy&quot;, you want Main mode and make the PFS setting agree with
whatever FreeSwan is doing (FreeSwan uses PFS by default). If you use PFS I
believe you must use DH group 2 as FreeSwan doesn't like group 1.

Phase 1 Authentication must be &quot;RSA signatures&quot; and 3DES plus either MD5 or
SHA-1 (I used MD5 but I believe FreeSwan accepts either). I left the
lifetime unspecified. Also you must select DH group 2 because I believe that
FreeSwan will not accept group 1.

Phase 2 also must use 3DES and MD5 or SHA-1. I used no compression and only
ESP and no AH, haven't tried other choices.

Hope this helps.</PRE>

Subject: Re: [Users] RE: SafeNet SoftRemote 6.1 - FS 1.91 - HOW?
Date: Fri, 16 Nov 2001

Things I've learned in getting SoftRemote working with FreeS/WAN:

Using SoftRemote on dial-in, if there is any configuration adjustment for
which you stop and start FreeS/WAN, SoftRemote is totally lost until you
disconnect and dial in again. The SoftRemote &quot;Disconnect All&quot; and subsequent
&quot;Reload Polilcies&quot; options that show when right-clicking its icon in the
tray do not fix this - the only thing I've found that works is hanging up
and then redialing. This makes debugging a total pain, especially if you
think you're testing your changes, because you're not. 

Not sure if this affects fixed IP connections from SoftRemote, or what the
effective equivalent to hanging up and dialing in again would be to clear
the problem there if it exists.

Also, as I noted before: In configuring SoftRemote, there are a couple of
new menu options that Soft-PK didn't have, just in case you're following
examples given for that. Importantly, in setting the &quot;Remote Party Identity
and Addressing&quot; choose &quot;IP subnet&quot; rather than &quot;IP&quot;, and be sure to provide
a mask which matches the subnet mask for that conn in ipsec.conf (e.g.
255.255.255.0 and /24). </PRE>

   From: Derick Cassidy &lt;dcthebrain@geek.com&gt;

Just a quick note of success.  TimeStep Permit/Gate (2520) and
Free/Swan (June 4th snapshot) interoperate!

I have them working in AUTO mode, with IKE.  IPSec SA's are negotiated
with 3DES and MD5.

Here are the configs and a diagram for both configs.

left subnet---| Timestep | --- internet --- | Linux box |

The left subnet is defined as the red side of the timestep box.
 This network definition MUST exist in the Secure Map.

On the Linux box:

ipsec.conf

conn timestep
        type=tunnel
        left=209.yyy.xxx.6
        leftnexthop=209.yyy.xxx.1
        leftsubnet=209.yyy.xxx.128/25
        right=24.aaa.bbb.203
        rightnexthop=24.aaa.bbb.1
        rightsubnet=24.aaa.bbb.203/32
        keyexchange=ike
        keylife=8h
        keyingtries=0

In the TimeStep permit/gate Secure Map

begin static-map
        target &quot;209.yyy.xxx.128/255.255.255.128&quot;
        mode   &quot;ISAKMP-Shared&quot;
        tunnel &quot;209.yyy.xxx.6&quot;
end

In the TimeStep Security Descriptor file

begin security-descriptor
        Name    &quot;High&quot;
        IPSec   &quot;ESP 3DES MINUTES 300 or ESP 3DES HMAC MD5 MINUTES 300&quot;
        ISAKMP  &quot;IDENTITY PFS 3DES MD5 MINUTES 1440
                                or DES MD5 MINUTES 1440&quot;
end

The timestep has a shared secret for 24.aaa.bbb.203/255.255.255.255
set in the Shared Secret Authentication tab of Permit/Config.</PRE>

<P>Here are some mailing list comments from FreeS/WAN tech support
 person Claudia Schmeing on this:</P>
<PRE>It certainly has been possible to interop between Radguard VPN gateways and
past Linux FreeS/WAN versions, as is evidenced by 
http://www.opus1.com/vpn/atl99display.html, as well as my own interop results
from San Diego this year. There have been no major changes since SD that 
I would foresee affecting this.

The Radguard team said that their VPN gateway will not respond to a peer 
request with PFS (Perfect Forward Secrecy) on, but it *will* successfully 
establish such a connection with Linux FreeS/WAN when Radguard is the
initiator. Since PFS is a desirable feature in terms of cryptographic
security, this asymmetry may frustrate efforts to provide a connection that 
is both as reliable as secure as possible.

While it's not clear that rekeying will present a problem, I suspect that 
some fine tuning of the key life parameters may be needed. Unfortunately 
I was unable to do additional tests on this topic.

Due to the PFS issue, when trying to maintain a connection with PFS,
you may need to set the rekeying times shorter on the radguard side,
in order to ensure that it is always the initiator.</PRE>

All,

FYI, I got a connection working between my Linux box &amp; AS/400. I had to make
two adjustments to the code...

1) Ignore the commit flag. (There were some patches floating on the list
last week)

2) Make FreeS/WAN start with proposal # 1
To do this, I modified connections.c and inserted after line 1006...
/* Hack to make AS/400 happy */

 Dilan Arumainathan answered:
<PRE>All you need to do is to:

1. Enable NetBIOS over TCP.
2. Create a &quot;lmhosts&quot; file and enter the address of a BDC or a PDC like
    192.168.1.[x]  [Your PDC/BDC servername] #PRE #DOM:[Your Domain Name]
    eg. 192.168.1.1 MYOWNPDC #PRE #DOM:DENSI-NT

3. Reboot if necessary.</PRE>
 and Sebastien Pfieffer provided a slightly different answer:
<PRE>For a trust relationship to work between NT domains in different
(sub)nets all domain controllers of the 1st domain have to know about
all controllers of the other domain.
Either you use the described LMHOSTS entry for every domain controller
of both domains or consider setting up WINS service(s).</PRE>
 We suspect that in some cases it may be more complex than that. See the

I've written a small Tool for freeswan-win2k Interaction.
Using this tool you can use a roadwarrior running Win2K
to connect to Freeswan 1.91 with X509 patch.

The tool has the following features:

- FreeSwan like Configuration File
- It sets up the complete Win2k configuration
- It reads dynamic RAS/DHCP adresses and updates the IPSec Config

You only need the following items:
1. Win2k Client
2. Win2k Service Pack 2 (for high encryption)
3. Microsoft ipsecpol tool (included in the resource kit / Downloadable
from Microsoft)
4. FreeSwan with working X.509 Patch and X.509 Certificates for your
Clients
5. FreeSwan like Config-File
6. The small &quot;ipsec.exe&quot; Tool

I have tested it on several Client PCs in different environment

I am planning to offer it as Open Source. Right now I don't know the
right way of distributing my work. Because of the widespread interest,
I would like to place it on the FreeSwan homepage.

Rightnow anyone interested should mail me for a Copy, so I get some
more testers.

Thank you for the great FreeSwan System !!!</PRE>
