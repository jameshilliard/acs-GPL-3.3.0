* kfw-fixed.nsi:
  Microsoft did not place the AllowTGTSessionKey in the same place
  for both XP SP2 and the server platforms.  Even though they said
  they would.  Modify the installer to set both locations.

* kfw.nsi, kfw-fixed.nsi, utils.nsi:
  - replace the UpdateDLL macro with the ReplaceDLL macro
  - use ReplaceDLL to install all .exe and .dll files
  this will allow the installer to work even when some files
  are loaded by modules which cannot be terminated such as 
  Network Providers (afslogon.dll for example)

2004-04-14  Jeffrey Altman <jaltman@mit.edu>

* nsi-includes.nsi:  update version to 2.6.1

* kfw-fixed.nsi:  add kvno.exe, gss-client.exe, gss-server.exe

* Add the NSIS installer for KFW 2.6 to the repository
