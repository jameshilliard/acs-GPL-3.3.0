Java Applet Directory

This directory contains the sources used to create the telnet/ssh
java applet that is used to connect to the serial ports from the
Cyclades web services. 

To create generate the java applet, you must have java development
kit installed in your environment. The following packages were installed
in genesis in order to build the java applet.
1.  Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition 1.4.2_01. I got it from
the download section of www.sun.com. 
(Specifically, http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html. 
Linux RPM, self-extracting file) The rpm installed the java directory
in /usr. 
2. Jdom Build System. Installed in /usr/jdom-b8.
3. Gnu.regexp. Installed in /usr/gnu.regexp-1.1.4.  

All of the above packages (.tar, .rpm) are saved in /usr/local/src. 
You can obtain them and install them in your environment. 

After installing these packages and creating the appropriate linkages, 
you, modified the main Makefile ($PROJ/Makefile). Specify the path of some 
of these packages in the CLASSPATH.
 
The main source codes are in the /de/mud. After modifying the sources, 
you can return to the main directory ($PROJ) and 'make javaApplet'. This
will create a jar file that also gets copied into the /appl directory.
Then when you generate a zImage, the jar file in /appl will get saved
into the image.
